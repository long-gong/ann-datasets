# Datasets

Please download the datasets before running the MATLAB codes. Currently, our MATLAB codes only support datasets from the following two sites

## IRISA

Datasets from [irisa](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/), please download and extract to `./inria/{DATASET-NAME}/`. For example, 
```
.\INRIA
└─ANN_GIST1M
        gist_base.fvecs
        gist_groundtruth.ivecs
        gist_learn.fvecs
        gist_query.fvecs
```

## Tiny Images Dataset

Datasets from [tiny images](http://horatio.cs.nyu.edu/mit/tiny/data/index.html), please download and extract to `./tiny/{DATASET-NAME}/`. Note that for playing with this dataset, your MATLAB should support C/C++ compile (For more details, please refer to the MATLAB codes provided by the tiny images website).
